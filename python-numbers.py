#Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example −
var1 = 1
var2 = 10

#You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement. The syntax of the del statement is −
#del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]
#You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement. For example −
del var1
print(var1)

'''Python supports three different numerical types −
int (signed integers)
float (floating point real values)
complex (complex numbers)
All integers in Python3 are represented as long integers. Hence, there is no separate number type as long.'''

'''Examples
Here are some examples of numbers −
int	float	complex
10	0.10	3.14j'''

'''A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x + yj, 
where x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.'''
