'''A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated
by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis.

The main difference between lists and tuples are − Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size
can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as
read-only lists. For example −'''

tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
tinytuple = (123, 'john')

print (tuple)           # Prints complete tuple
print (tuple[0])        # Prints first element of the tuple
print (tuple[1:3])      # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd
print (tuple[2:])       # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print (tinytuple * 2)   # Prints tuple two times
print (tuple + tinytuple) # Prints concatenated tuple

'''The following code is invalid with tuple, because we attempted to update a tuple, which is not allowed. Similar case 
is possible with lists −'''

'''tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  ]
tuple[2] = 1000    # Invalid syntax with tuple
list[2] = 1000     # Valid syntax with list'''
