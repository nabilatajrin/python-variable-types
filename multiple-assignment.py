#Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.
print('test 1')
a = b = c = 1

print(a)

#Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all the three variables are assigned to the same memory
# location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example âˆ’
