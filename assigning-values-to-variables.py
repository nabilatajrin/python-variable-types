'''Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically
when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.'''

counter = 100          # An integer assignment
miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
name    = "John"       # A string

print (counter)
